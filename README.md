# Financial-Transaction-Fraud-Analysis
Analyzing fraud patterns in Indian banking ecosystem using Power BI, Excel, Python, and SQL.

Hi, I'm currently exploring data analytics and this is one of the projects I worked on — analyzing financial fraud transactions and building a dashboard around it using Power BI, Python, SQL and Excel.

## About the Project

The idea behind this project was to understand how and when financial frauds occur — like through which channels (UPI, Card, ATM etc.), at what time of day, and in which states or cities. I wanted to create something useful that can help detect fraud patterns and show them in a visual, interactive way.

## Tools Used

- Power BI (for dashboard)
- Excel (for data cleaning & exploration)
- Python (for basic EDA)
- SQL (for slicing/filtering the data)

## Folder Structure

- `PowerBI_Dashboards/` – contains 5 dashboard screenshots
- `Dataset/` – the CSV file I used for analysis (cleaned & structured)
- `Python_EDA_Code/` – exploratory data analysis in Jupyter Notebook



## Key Points I Focused On

- How frauds vary by hour of the day (lots happening at night!)
- Which transaction channels are most abused (UPI & Cards)
- What merchant categories are riskier (like food delivery, fuel)
- How fraud patterns vary by device type and user behavior
- State and city-wise hotspots

## Dashboard Pages I Created

1. Overview – total frauds, daily trends, map by state
2. Time & Location – hourly + weekday trends, map views
3. Channel & Merchant – which platforms and categories are risky
4. Device & User – which devices are used more in frauds
5. Drill-down – detailed fraud table, user vs time matrix, treemap for hotspots

This helped me understand how to break down a problem, create visuals that actually tell a story, and how to use different tools together in one project.

Thanks for checking it out!
